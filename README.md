# Week 02 - Data Engineering Project for Collecting Weather Data

🚀 Introduction:

Welcome back to my data engineering journey! This weekend, I delve into the realm of weather data collection and analysis, utilising the power of OpenWeatherAPI, Python, Airflow, AWS Glue, AWS Redshift and Tableau Cloud. Follow along as I create a data pipeline for the extraction, transformation, and loading of weather data.

🔍 Project Overview:

In this project, my focus shifts towards weather data, a crucial aspect in numerous domains from agriculture to transportation. Leveraging Python and Airflow, I've constructed a robust pipeline for automated weather data collection. This pipeline efficiently extracts weather data, stores it in an S3 repository and seamlessly transforms it using AWS Glue. Finally, the transformed data finds its home in AWS Redshift, ready for in-depth analysis and visualization through Tableau.

🛠️ Technical Details:

Python and Airflow form the backbone of this project, orchestrating the entire data pipeline effortlessly. By integrating AWS Glue into the workflow, I ensure efficient data transformation, enabling seamless integration with AWS Redshift. With AWS Redshift as the destination, data is stored in a scalable and performant manner, ready to support analytical queries. Additionally, establishing a Tableau connection enhances the accessibility and visual appeal of the analyzed data.

📈 Next Steps:

While this project marks a significant milestone in my data engineering journey, there's always room for improvement. With more time at hand, I would aim to further enhance automation across the entire data pipeline, extending beyond just the data extraction phase handled by Airflow. By automating additional aspects such as data quality checks, error handling, and dynamic scaling of resources based on workload demands, I strive to create a truly self-sustaining and efficient data ecosystem.

🙏 Thank You:

Thank you for accompanying me on this voyage through the intricacies of data engineering! Your support, feedback, and ideas are invaluable as I continue to expand my skills and knowledge in this dynamic field. Feel free to delve into the code, share your thoughts, or reach out with any queries or suggestions.

Happy coding! 🌟
